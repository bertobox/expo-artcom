CHANGED  CSS     TAGS      Print CSS template for outputting the OBRA tags. Currently NOT applying page-break-after:always; when elements are floated
CHANGED  PHP     TAGS      $autores needs to print as a comma separated array and with a 'y' separator for the last author’s name
TODO     ?       TAGS      implement mechanism that [can be toggled on/off] to auto-detect when 8 [or any given number of] new pieces have been added thus setting up those pages ready to print, or creating a pdf and downloading it. [This could be further combined with a Automator watched folder that detects when new PDFs have been added and proceeds to send them to print and then moves them to another folder.]

Never mind, this has been done and the download re-added te extension at the end.
