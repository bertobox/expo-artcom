#‘EXPO ARTCOM’

This project is named ‘EXPO ARTCOM’ for the time being, as it was initially conceived to help a group of university students register and upload pieces for an end-of-semester student portfolio exhibition that happens every spring and fall semester at the School of Arts and Communication at Montemorelos University.

The coding stemming as a result of this project has the potential to serve other purposes as well. It borrows from several other open-source projects, for which we are very thankful and credit in the TODO file for the time being.

In its most technical sense, this project is a PHP/JS based system that works with a MySQL database to capture registration data and file uploads tied to that registration ‘session’, and then allowing you to output the captured registration information in a list view, a gallery view and a printable view.

To use this project, a user will most likely need a computer/server with MySQL, PHP access. Also, enough disk space to receive the files that are being submitted to the form.

## Status ##

For the time being, this project is **not** finished. The basic upload interface works, but there is still no deep documentation. The gallery view is also not ready.
